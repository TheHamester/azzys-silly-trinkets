# Azzy's Silly Trinkets

Azzy's Silly Trinkets (AST) is a Balatro modification which adds silly miscallaeneous content to the game. Mostly serves as a playground for me to experiment and get more acquainted with Balatro modding.Can't guarantee the content is balanced or won't crash the game, but I try my best!

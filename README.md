# Azzy's Silly Trinkets

**Azzy's Silly Trinkets** (AST) is a Balatro modification which adds silly miscallaeneous content to the game. Mostly serves as a playground for me to experiment and get more acquainted with Balatro modding. Can't guarantee the content is balanced or won't crash your game, but I try my best to keep it robust!  
  
So far this mod only contains 10 new Boss Blinds, and 5 Jokes.
